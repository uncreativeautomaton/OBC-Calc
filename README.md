Code for calculators to help with Ontario Building Code calculations

The Ontario Building Code is a massive two binder document that regulates how buildings are to be constructed in Ontario, based on the National Building Code, in Canada.

There are a lot of confusing calculations, conditions etc in the code, and I want to create a few calculators to help assist architects and designers to simplify the process and hopefully minimize human errors.

Calculations to be covered:
- Footing Width
- Stairway Width (tall buildings)
- Occupancy (calculating both from a given area to determine occupancy, and from a needed occupancy rate to determine min. area needed)
- Major Occupancy (determining what is the building type defined by the major occupancy-ex mercantile, medical, office etc)

...more calculation topics to be covered as I come across them.

For liability purposes, please double check these calculations yourself too, as these are preliminary! I am not a registered architect, but an architectural technology student. This is for educational purposes only.
